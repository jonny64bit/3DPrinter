# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware for Creality3D CR-10S

Currently based off Marlin 1.1.9 and stock CR-10S

Works with latest arduino

You need to import the 'u8glib_arduino_v1.18.1.zip' library in 'Librarys' folder.

I'll be tweaking this going forward to improve print quality.

*Use at own risk. Only tested on 1 CR-10S so far*

## Other peoples' work used and taken bits from.

Big thanks to all
